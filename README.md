# Netflix-clone
Open this React project on firebase [https://netflix-abe80.web.app/](https://netflix-abe80.web.app/)

This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up. Login connects to Firebase when the user tries to sign in, and when the user signs up, we use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. In this React app, I use Styled Components for all the styling I implement. I use React knowledge(useEffect, useState, useContext) and JavaScript knowledge for using higher order functions such as map, filter, reduce, and find. I also use React router for navigation, Fuse.js for live search, and testing all components using React Testing Library.
